This RPG has been made as part of my iOs developper course from OpenClassrooms.

Here are the constraints:

  1. First project: Create a RPG in CLI.

  2. Initializing the game by asking each player to choose characters for their team.  
  Each player would have to choose a unique name for each character.

  3. It's a turn-based game. Player 1 chooses a character from his team.  
  Then chooses his target (from his team if it's a heal, from the opponant's team if it's an attack).  
  Makes the action. Check if the game is over, otherwise it's player 2's turn.

  4. When the game is over (all characters from all opponants are dead), display the winner and game statistics.

  5. The game is composed of 2 players. Each player has a team of 3 characters.  
  Characters must have health points, a name and a weapon.  

  6. Add a random chest containing a weapon, which can pop out at each character's turn.  

I did a little bit more than what was asked :

  1. You can set as many players ( 2..* ) and as many characters ( 1..* )as you want, the game still works the same way.

  2. Players have to choose a name. 

  3. Re-play functionality.
  
  4. An UML class diagram. (../Architecture.pdf)
